# PiGen

PIN Generator

Generate all possible combinations of PIN with batch file and only with batch ( 4 digits code and 6 digits code OR CUSTOMIZE DIGIT(s)-PiGen2.bat), for Windows only at the moment

In the future, i will create new batch file, shellscript (not this) which will generate all possible combinations alphabet, numeric, special characters password, customize length, support Mac, linux and windows

This is a official release version for Windows ( ver 5.2.3 - Origin Is Unreachable )

Release alpha for linux and mac @bash/alpha

## how to use

Copy and paste the code from bat file here to your new text document then remame it to *.bat

_Why?_

 If you download, all the code messed up so it will not do what it does and hard to modify.
